# VadaProject / application

_Warning: This document is a work in progress, and is currently only ready for internal usage._

This repository holds the PHP files which make up the application's front-end.

## Installation (local development)

1. Download and install...
   - [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
   - [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) (globally)
     - macOS: `brew install php composer`
   - [PHP-CS-Fixer]()
     - ```sh
       composer require --global friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer
       ```
1. From the control panel, start the Apache and MySQL servers.
1. From XAMPP's `htdocs/` folder, clone this repository, and name the folder `directory`.
   - ```sh
     cd [xampp_root]/htdocs
     git clone <repo_url>.git directory
     ```
1. Log into the phpMyAdmin dashboard (usually at <https://localhost/phpmyadmin/>)
1. Create a new database called `vadaProject`.
   - From the SQL tab, load and execute the commands in `vadaProject.sql`.
   - This should populate the database with two tables.
1. Create a new user account.
   - Set username, password to match the ones in `config/db_connect.php`.
   - Change hostname from '`%`' to `localhost`.
   - ðŸš¨ For security reasons, this should be refactored to load database credentials from a .env file instead.
